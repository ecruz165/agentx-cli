# Spring Integration

Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with [Spring Integration], including the `spring-boot-starter-integration` starter.
Spring Integration provides abstractions over messaging and also other transports such as HTTP, TCP, and others.
If Spring Integration is available on your classpath, it is initialized through the `@EnableIntegration` annotation.

Spring Integration polling logic relies on the auto-configured `TaskScheduler`.
The default `PollerMetadata` (poll unbounded number of messages every second) can be customized with `spring.integration.poller.*` configuration properties.

Spring Boot also configures some features that are triggered by the presence of additional Spring Integration modules.
If `spring-integration-jmx` is also on the classpath, message processing statistics are published over JMX.
If `spring-integration-jdbc` is available, the default database schema can be created on startup, as shown in the following line:

```yaml
spring:
  integration:
    jdbc:
      initialize-schema: "always"
```

If `spring-integration-rsocket` is available, developers can configure an RSocket server using `spring.rsocket.server.*` properties and let it use `IntegrationRSocketEndpoint` or `RSocketOutboundGateway` components to handle incoming RSocket messages.
This infrastructure can handle Spring Integration RSocket channel adapters and `@MessageMapping` handlers (given `spring.integration.rsocket.server.message-mapping-enabled` is configured).

Spring Boot can also auto-configure an `ClientRSocketConnector` using configuration properties:

```yaml
# Connecting to a RSocket server over TCP
spring:
  integration:
    rsocket:
      client:
        host: "example.org"
        port: 9898
```

```yaml
# Connecting to a RSocket Server over WebSocket
spring:
  integration:
    rsocket:
      client:
        uri: "ws://example.org"
```

See the /autoconfigure/IntegrationAutoConfiguration.java[`IntegrationAutoConfiguration`] and `IntegrationProperties` classes for more details.
