# Spring Batch

Spring Boot offers several conveniences for working with [Spring Batch], including running a Job on startup.

When building a batch application, the following stores can be auto-configured:

* In-memory
* JDBC

Each store has specific additional settings.
For instance, it is possible to customize the tables prefix for the JDBC store, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
spring:
  batch:
    jdbc:
      table-prefix: "CUSTOM_"
```

To disable Spring Boot's auto-configuration and take complete control of Spring Batch's configuration, add `@EnableBatchProcessing` to one of your `@Configuration` classes or extend `DefaultBatchConfiguration`.
This will cause the auto-configuration to back off, including initialization of Spring Batch's database schema if you're using the JDBC-based store.
Spring Batch can then be configured using the `@Enable*JobRepository` annotation's attributes rather than the previously described configuration properties.

To learn more about manually configuring Spring Batch, see the API documentation of:

* `DefaultBatchConfiguration`
* `@EnableBatchProcessing`
* `@EnableJdbcJobRepository`
* `@EnableMongoJobRepository`

For more information about Spring Batch, see the [Spring Batch project page].

## Running Spring Batch Jobs on Startup

When Spring Boot auto-configures Spring Batch, and if a single `Job` bean is found in the application context, it is executed on startup (see `JobLauncherApplicationRunner` for details).
If multiple `Job` beans are found, the job that should be executed must be specified using `spring.batch.job.name`.

You can disable running a `Job` found in the application context, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
spring:
  batch:
    job:
      enabled: false
```

See /autoconfigure/BatchAutoConfiguration.java[`BatchAutoConfiguration`] and  /autoconfigure/BatchJdbcAutoConfiguration.java[`BatchJdbcAutoConfiguration`] for more details.
