# Packaging Your Application for Production

Once your Spring Boot application is ready for production deployment, there are many options for packaging and optimizing
the application.
See the  section of the documentation to read about these features.

For additional "production ready" features, such as health, auditing, and metric REST or JMX end-points, consider adding `spring-boot-actuator`.
See  for details.
