# Structuring Your Code

Spring Boot does not require any specific code layout to work.
However, there are some best practices that help.

> **Tip:** If you wish to enforce a structure based on domains, take a look at [Spring Modulith](https://spring.io/projects/spring-modulith#overview).

## Using the "`default`" Package

When a class does not include a `package` declaration, it is considered to be in the "`default package`".
The use of the "`default package`" is generally discouraged and should be avoided.
It can cause particular problems for Spring Boot applications that use the `@ComponentScan`, `@ConfigurationPropertiesScan`, `@EntityScan`, or `@SpringBootApplication` annotations, since every class from every jar is read.

> **Tip:** We recommend that you follow Java's recommended package naming conventions and use a reversed domain name (for example, `com.example.project`).

## Locating the Main Application Class

We generally recommend that you locate your main application class in a root package above other classes.
The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is often placed on your main class, and it implicitly defines a base "`search package`" for certain items.
For example, if you are writing a JPA application, the package of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotated class is used to search for `@Entity` items.
Using a root package also allows component scan to apply only on your project.

> **Tip:** If you do not want to use `@SpringBootApplication`, the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `@ComponentScan` annotations that it imports defines that behavior so you can also use those instead.

The following listing shows a typical layout:

[source]
```
com
 `- example
     `- myapplication
         `- MyApplication.java
         |
         `- customer
         |   `- Customer.java
         |   `- CustomerController.java
         |   `- CustomerService.java
         |   `- CustomerRepository.java
         |
         `- order
             `- Order.java
             `- OrderController.java
             `- OrderService.java
             +- OrderRepository.java
```

The `MyApplication.java` file would declare the `main` method, along with the basic `@SpringBootApplication`, as follows:

```java
// Example: MyApplication
```
